I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UC Berkeley, fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. [Shafi Goldwasser](https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=1088) and Prof. [John Wright](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jswright/).

My research interests lie broadly in theoretical computer science. Recently, I have been thinking about cryptography and quantum computing.

In Spring 2022 I received an M.Eng. degree from MIT, where I was lucky to work under the supervision of Prof. [Vinod Vaikuntanathan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/). I graduated with a bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering and in Mathematics in Spring 2021 from the same institution. I am grateful for the mentorship of Prof. [Virginia Vassilevska Williams](https://people.csail.mit.edu/virgi) during my undergraduate studies.
